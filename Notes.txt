usePathname() hook in next.js
	The usePathname hook in Next.js is used to get the current URL pathname in app router (app/ directory) introduced with Next.js 13+.
	
What usePathname Returns :- 
It returns a string of the current URL path.

For example, if the user is on /about, it returns "/about".

⚠️ Important Notes
You must mark the component using this hook with 'use client' since it's a client component hook.

Works only with the App Router (app/ directory) — not with Pages Router (pages/ directory).
